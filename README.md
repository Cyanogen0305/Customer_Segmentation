## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation using the KMeans clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of modern marketing, enabling businesses to identify and target specific groups within their customer base for more effective marketing strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes basic information about customers, such as:

- Customer ID
- Age
- Gender
- Annual Income
- Spending Score

The data is sourced from a supermarket's membership program, containing 200 records of customer information.

## Usage

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cyanogen0305/Customer_Segmentation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd customer-segmentation
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:

   Start the Jupyter notebook to explore the project:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook customer-segmentation.ipynb
   ```

## Models Used

This project employs the following models and techniques:

- **KMeans Clustering**: The primary algorithm used to segment customers into distinct groups based on their demographic and spending behavior.
- **Elbow Method**: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters for the KMeans algorithm.

## Results

The results of the project are visualized in the Jupyter notebook, showcasing the identified customer segments. These segments provide insights into different customer groups, helping to tailor marketing strategies more effectively.
